## Introduction

This game is contributed by [**Gordon Wai Hin Kam**](https://github.com/li23179) and [**Ivan (Leung Ka Ho)**](https://github.com/nm22031)

Scotland Yard is a board game in which a team of players controlling different detectives cooperate to track down a player controlling a criminal as they move around a board representing the streets of London. 

It was first published in 1983 and is named after Scotland Yard which is the headquarters of London's Metropolitan Police Service in real-life.

## Setup

There are **two** roles in this game *detectives* and *Mr.X*. One player is assigned to *Mr.X* and the rest of it are *detectives*.

### Components
- **GameBoard**: A map of London featuring 199 stations connected by colored lines (taxi, bus, and underground).
- **Tickets**: Used for movement; there are taxi tickets, bus tickets, underground tickets, and special secret tickets for Mr. X.
- **Log Book**: Mr. X uses this to secretly record his moves.

### Movement Rules

- **Mr. Xâ€™s Moves**: Mr. X writes down his moves in the log book and shows only the type of ticket he uses (keeping his exact location secret). Every **3rd**, **8th**, **13th**, and **18th** move, Mr. X must reveal his exact location.

- **Detective Moves**: Detectives announce their moves aloud and give up a ticket of the corresponding type each time they move. They cannot move if they run out of applicable tickets.
